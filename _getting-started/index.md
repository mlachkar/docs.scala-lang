## Try Scala without installing anything 
You can [try Scala in your browser](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/MHc7C9iiTbGfeSAvg8CKAA), with access to all Scala compilers and 
all published libraries.

##  Installing Scala
### Using the Scala Installer (recommended way)
The Scala installer is a tool named `cs` that ensures that a JVM and standard Scala tools are installed on your system.  

* Download the `cs` tool and execute the `setup` command

<div class="main-download">
    <div id="download-step-one">
        <p>Follow <a href="https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-overview.html#install-native-launcher" target="_blank">the instructions to install the <code>cs</code> launcher</a> then run:</p>
        <p><code>$ ./cs setup</code></p>
    </div>
</div>


Along with managing JVMs, it also installs useful command line tools: 
ammonite, coursier, scala, scalac, sbt-launcher, scalafmt.

For more information, read [coursier-cli documentation](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-overview)

### ...Or manually
1. if you don't have Java 1.8 or 11 installed, download 
Java from [Oracle Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html), [
Oracle Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html), 
or [AdoptOpenJDK 8/11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). Refer [JDK Compatibility](/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html) for Scala/Java compatibility detail.
1. Install [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)


## Create a Hello-world project with sbt
### Using command-line
sbt is a build tool for Scala. sbt compiles, runs, 
and tests your projects among other related tasks.

1. `cd` to an empty folder.
1. Run the following command `sbt new scala/hello-world.g8`.
This pulls the 'hello-world' template from GitHub.
It will also create a `target` folder, which you can ignore.
1. When prompted, name the application `hello-world`. This will
create a project called "hello-world".
1. Let's take a look at what just got generated:

```
- hello-world
    - project (sbt uses this to install and manage plugins and dependencies)
        - build.properties
    - src
        - main
            - scala (All of your scala code goes here)
                - Main.scala (Entry point of program) <-- this is all we need for now
    - build.sbt (sbt's build definition file)
```

More documentation about sbt can be found in the [Scala Book](/overviews/scala-book/scala-build-tool-sbt.html) 
or in the official sbt [documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html)

### Without using command-line
You can skip the rest of this page and go directly to [Building a Scala Project with IntelliJ and sbt](/getting-started/intellij-track/building-a-scala-project-with-intellij-and-sbt.html#next-steps)


## Open hello-world project
### Using Intellij
1. Download and install [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
1. Install Scala plugin by following [the instructions on how to install IntelliJ plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html)
1. Open the `build.sbt` file then choose *Open as a project*

### Using VSCode with metals 
1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. Install the Metals extension from [the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals)
1. Next, open the directory containing a `build.sbt` file. When prompted to do so, select *Import build*.

## Run Hello World
Open a terminal
1. `cd` into `hello-world`.
1. Run `sbt`. This will open up the sbt console.
1. Type `~run`. The `~` is optional and causes sbt to re-run on every file save,
allowing for a fast edit/run/debug cycle. sbt will also generate a `target` directory
which you can ignore.
